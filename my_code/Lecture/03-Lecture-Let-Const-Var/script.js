// LECTURE: let, const and var
// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live
// 2. Think about which variables should be const variables
// (which values will never change, and which might change?). 
//Then, change these variables to const.
// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now,and observe what happens
